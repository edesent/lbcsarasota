              If I were to die today, would I spend eternity in Heaven with God? It is the most
              important question any of us will ever answer — and your relationship to the Lord
              Jesus Christ is central to that answer. The Bible makes the way plain.

                Ever since Adam and Eve, every one of us has inherited a sinful nature. The Bible

                A Prayer of Salvation

                Salvation is not in the words of a prayer, but in trusting Christ from your heart.
                If you understand your need and want to trust Him as your Saviour, you might pray
                something like this:
              </p>
              <p className="font-serif italic text-text-dark leading-relaxed">
                &ldquo;Dear God, I know that I am separated from you because of sin. I confess that
                in my sin, I cannot save myself. Right now, I turn to you alone to be my Saviour. I
                ask you to save me from the penalty of my sin, and I trust you to provide eternal
                life to me. Amen.&rdquo;
